      <p class="text-sm text-gray-700">
        Why Tigers Are Endangered:
        Tigers are endangered due to habitat loss, poaching, climate change, and human-wildlife conflict. These threats have greatly reduced their population in the wild. 
        <p class="text-sm text-gray-700">
            We can save tigers by protecting their habitats, stopping illegal hunting, supporting conservation efforts, and raising public awareness.

        <p class="text-sm text-gray-700">
          Why Amur Leopards Are Endangered:
          The Amur leopard is endangered due to poaching and loss of its forest habitat in eastern Russia and China. Its population is very small, making it vulnerable to inbreeding.     
          <p class="text-sm text-gray-700"></p>
          We can save it by protecting its natural habitat and enforcing anti-poaching laws. Breeding programs in conservation centers also help increase its numbers.

        <p class="text-sm text-gray-700">
          Why Javan Rhinos Are Endangered:
          Javan rhinos are critically endangered because of habitat loss and past hunting. Today, only a few survive in one national park in Indonesia.
          <p class="text-sm text-gray-700">
            Protecting this last habitat and monitoring the remaining rhinos closely is key. Preventing human encroachment and increasing security can support their survival.

        <p class="text-sm text-gray-700">
          Why Mountain Gorillas Are Endangered:
          Mountain gorillas are endangered due to habitat destruction, poaching, and disease. Human activities like farming and deforestation are major threats.      
          <p class="text-sm text-gray-700">
            Conservation programs, ecotourism, and community education have helped increase their numbers. Continued support for protected areas is essential.

        <h3 class="text-xl font-bold"> Sumatran Tiger</h3>
        <p class="text-sm text-gray-700">
          Why Sumatran Tigers Are Endangered:
          The Sumatran tiger is endangered from illegal hunting and shrinking forests. Palm oil plantations and logging have destroyed much of its habitat
          <p class="text-sm text-gray-700">
            We can help by supporting sustainable farming and protecting forest reserves. Stricter anti-poaching efforts are also needed.

        <h3 class="text-xl font-bold">Vaquitas</h3>
        <p class="text-sm text-gray-700">
          Why Vaquitas Are Endangered:
          The vaquita, the world's rarest marine mammal, is critically endangered due to getting caught in illegal fishing nets. There are fewer than 10 left.
          <p class="text-sm text-gray-700">
            Saving them requires banning gillnet fishing in their habitat and improving patrols. Public pressure on governments can help enforce these actions.

            <p class="text-sm text-gray-700">
              Why Hawksbill Turles Are Endangered:
              Hawksbill turtles are endangered due to illegal trade of their beautiful shells and destruction of coral reef habitats. Climate change also affects their nesting sites.
              
              <p class="text-sm text-gray-700">
                We can protect them by banning the turtle shell trade and preserving coral reefs. Beach conservation efforts also help protect their nests and hatchlings.

                <h3 class="text-xl font-bold">African Wild Dogs</h3>
                <p class="text-sm text-gray-700">
                  Why African wild dogs Are Endangered:
                  African wild dogs are endangered because of habitat loss, disease from domestic animals, and human conflict. Their packs are small and easily disrupted.                
                    <p class="text-sm text-gray-700">
                        We can help by preserving large protected areas and vaccinating domestic dogs nearby. Educating local communities can reduce conflict and support conservation.

                    <p class="text-sm text-gray-700">
                      Why Orangunatn Are Endangered:
                      Orangutans are endangered because of deforestation, especially for palm oil plantations, and illegal wildlife trade. They are losing their forest homes at an alarming rate.
                    <p class="text-sm text-gray-700">
                        We can help by supporting sustainable palm oil, protecting rainforests, and rescuing and rehabilitating captured orangutans. Education and stronger laws are also crucial.
